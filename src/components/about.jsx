        <p>
          Hello, I'm Samriddh Diwan, an aspiring technologist currently pursuing
          Electronics and Communication with a specialization in Internet of
          Things at Netaji Subhash University of Technology. From the early days
          of my education, programming has captivated me, igniting a passion
          that has driven my desire for a career in software development.
          <br />
          Although I have only scratched the surface of the vast field of
          development, I approach it with unwavering enthusiasm. While I may
          have embarked on this journey a bit later than some, I am ready to
          kindle the flames of my enthusiasm and dive headfirst into the world
          of software development.
        </p>
